!NOTE
Started as acceptance tester and writing tests in excel in 2007.
taken requirements from use case specifications

process far from ideal. I started automating acceptance test write record and
playback tool

as I worked for several companies and around 2009 I learned more about
CI and CD and immediately knew this was something that could
help me accelerate the delivery process.

Now we put docker in the mix and CD really took off.

So why is?
